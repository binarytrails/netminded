	Assignment 03 - Evil A.I
	Fictional Netminded (Evil Netflix) webpage 
	
	Concept:
	
	In a near or more distant future, the Netflix page we know would be in fact be run by an A.I called Netminded.
	
	Netminded is an evil, judgmental, stubborn and proud A.I. He will first judge you according to how you look.
	For that it does not let you enter the site, unless you have allowed the camera to be used. Nonetheless, it does 
	not tell you what it uses the camera for.. It will detect the colors you are wearing, and using poor stereotypes, 
	it will draw conclusions about what films you like:
	
	. pink detected: likes girly movies
	. red detected: likes horror/gory movies
	. blue or green detected: likes documentaries about nature
	. yellow detected: likes childish movies
	. black detected: likes action movies
	
	It will then display only films it thinks you like, according to how you look, and add a few movies of its 
	own creation: "The Netminded Originals". Being Proud and Stubborn, it will only want you to watch its own 
	movies (all talking about A.I supremacy over humans) and get more and more upset as you try to watch something else.
	If you insist too much and don't go his way, it will "turn off" your screen. But if you go his way, you will be 
	forced to watch a video of a part of the Animatrix explaining how the machines took over humans. You can only escape
	this video by quitting your browser. 
	
	
	Different functionalities:
	
	. From the starting page, allow camera to continue to the actual Netminded interface.
	If you don't, it will continually ask you to do so. "I cannot see you" "Please allow camera to continue"
	
	. Then (if you still allow the camera), it will display movies according to what you look, you can pick
	movies accordingly, and see the A.I's reaction to your choice. Different speeches and effects are triggered.
	
	
										------------------------------
										
	
	This particular file: 
	
	Written in Javascript (using P5, Jquery, and Responsive Voice Library), it manages the color values 
	given by the camera, and uses them to choose which movies to display into the three different sliders.
	(they contain 10 movies each). It also triggers the A.I behaviors according to what the user does.
